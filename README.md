This is a homework assignment for module 4, challenge WEB API for University of Arizona Coding Boot camp.




The assignment criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score


Quiz is functional to criteria.

Items I wanted to implement but did not get done:

I attempted to add message notice when timer reached "0", but could not get a working solution.
Better link to high scores page
More CSS to add some pizzaz, only basic colors and centering right now. 

Diverted from mock-up to make similar but sillier version to mock up.
